# Validator
# Sublist3r Domain Validator:

While using Sublist3r, a great tool for bugbountys. I found that it sometimes malforms its output and doesnt actually validate if the found domains are still live, this is a sub script to do that for you.

# Usage:

Please paste the Sublist3r domain output into the included domains.txt file and run the script, it will display what domains are still valid by seting a python get request to each domain, if you want to see which domains are dead, uncomment line 41.

Cheers.
